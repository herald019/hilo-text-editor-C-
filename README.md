# hilo-text-editor-C-

-> hilo is a text editor created using C language which works on a linux bash terminal

-> to open this text editor we need to install windows subsystem for linus (WSL), then open bash and navigate to the directory of the project

-> the hilo project was created with reference to a prior text editor kilo on the internet

-> this code is not entirely mine and was designed for learning purposes
